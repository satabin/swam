# Swam [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/satabin/swam.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/satabin/swam) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/6cadb836067c4e4696c3c15ab9510a3a)](https://www.codacy.com/app/satabin/swam?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=satabin/swam&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Swam is a [WebAssembly][1] interpreter written in Scala with the [cats][7] library. It passes all the official specification tests. It is under an Apache 2 license.

## Getting Started

To build it, we use [mill](http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/). Mill is not packaged for all Linux distributions, but you can use curl to install it (see Installation instructions in the [doc](http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/)).

You cann also use the [mill wrapper](https://github.com/lefou/millw) provided in this repository with the recommended mill version. It will download mill for you if you do not have it already, and run it. To use it, replace following `mill` commands by `./millw`

If you want to run the specification tests, just type:

```sh
mill runtime.test
```

It you want to test swam in a REPL session, just type tostart an ammonite shell with runtime project in classpath.:

```sh
mill -i runtime.console
```

If you want a REPL session with both runtime and text, the easiest way is to start a session for the runtime.test project:

    $ mill -i runtime.test.console

## Architecture

This project defines several modules:
 - The [`core`](core/) module is a library that makes it possible to manipulate [binary][3] representation of WebAssembly modules. In particular it contains:
   - a streaming parser for the binary format;
   - a compiler from text to binary format.
 - The [`runtime`](runtime/) module is a [non-web embedding][4] to instantiate and run WebAssembly modules.
 - The [`text`](text/) module is a library that makes it possible to manipulate [text][2] representation of WebAssembly modules.
   It is not included in the `core` module as text representation is more of a debug feature, and the runtime does not want to bring
   that dependency with it.
