This project defines several modules:

 - The `core` module is a library that makes it possible to manipulate [binary][binary-encoding] representation of WebAssembly modules. In particular it contains:
   - a streaming parser for the binary format;
   - a compiler from text to binary format.
 - The `runtime` module is a [non-web embedding][non-web-embedding] to instantiate and run WebAssembly modules.
 - The `text` module is a library that makes it possible to manipulate [text][text-format] representation of WebAssembly modules.
   It is not included in the `core` module as text representation is more of a debug feature, and the runtime does not want to bring
   that dependency with it.

If you want more details, please refer to the examples or [API documentation][api].
